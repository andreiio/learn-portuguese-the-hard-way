- What are you doing? Are you making toast?
- Yes. How many do you want?
- Two slices. I don't have much time, I have to leave soon.
- OK. Can you give me the knife? It is in the drawer.
- Here you are. Why are you making toast today?
- Because we have a lot of bread left over from yesterday. When do you have to leave?
- In ten minutes. When will be the toast ready?
- It is ready now. Bonapetit. Can you tell me why you have to leave so soon?
- I have to meet a man who has to give me a parcel.
- Do you have to meet him today?
- This toast is nice, but I can't eat while talking.
